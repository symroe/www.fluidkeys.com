# Co-op Middleman Template

## How to use this

### Co-op prototyping kit

We're using the [Co-op prototyping kit it](https://github.com/coopdigital/prototype-kit-proof-of-concept) for base Co-op styles.

### Middleman

Middleman is a static site generator using all the shortcuts and tools in modern web development. [Read more about Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

* Install Middleman with `gem install middleman`
* In the command line use `middleman build`
* Then, when working use `middleman serve`
* See your site at `localhost:4567`

### Co-op Design Manual

When adding elements to the page you should take a look at the [Co-op Design Manual](https://coop-design-manual.herokuapp.com/index.html).

### File structure

Co-op Prototyping folders are in `source/assets ...` and shouldn't be touched.

* Images should be added to `source/images`
* JavaScript to `source/javascripts`
* Additional styles for the prototype to `source/stylesheets`
